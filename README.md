# new-weather-
This weather application was built as a part of my training on FreeCodeCamp.com. It uses the geolocation feature and data from OpenWeather to provide the current temperature in the user's location, providing a different image depending on the conditions. It also gives users the option of switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit. 

I created all design, code and images (i.e. GIFS) for this project. You can view it using the below link.
